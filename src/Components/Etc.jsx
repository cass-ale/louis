        have both been fighting the Kaiser with some other suckers from Leeds, but here we ARE. Two pals with the world stretched out in front of them, waiting to be opened like an oyster
        or other similar shellfish and Devoured.</p>

        <p>Here's what we're here for, <a href='https://www.apartments.com/375-winthrop-ave-new-haven-ct/8weehx2/'>375 Wintrhop Ave</a>. I just toured this place in the flesh and it lives up to my expectations. Almost 2,000 square feet of charm. Brand new appliances and in the middle of renovations. With a 9/15 move in, there won't be a rush to move and you can take a full 30 days to add to your piggy bank.

It's close to a mall, grocery stores, and restaurants which means plenty of places to find employment quickly.

        <h1>Rent is a measly $750 per person, meaning the total move in cost is an even measilier $1500 for the first month + security deposit.</h1>

        <p>This is... all I can really add to this site. Please move to New Haven.</p>
